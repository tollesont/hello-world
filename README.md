# hello-world

As with all n00bs, I am getting started in the most traditional of ways.

And here we are--I am currently a TechApps/Broadcast instructor at a middle school with goals to move into computer science instruction. This seems like a good place to start.

I have been teaching computer science to 8th graders for the last 7-8 years. My new goal is to move to teaching CS to high schoolers. I am currently teaching myself Java to teach the AP CS-A course at McNeil HS.
